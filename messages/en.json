      {
        "question": "What if the project goes over budget?",
        "answer": "It won't. We provide fixed-price quotes after thorough scoping. In 5 years, we've never exceeded a quoted budget. If scope changes during the project, we discuss pricing transparently before any additional work begins—you'll never be surprised by a bill."
      },
      {
        "question": "I'm not technical—can I still work with you?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Most of our clients aren't technical, and that's perfectly fine. We explain everything in plain English, handle all the technical decisions, and keep you informed without overwhelming you with jargon. You focus on your business; we handle the tech."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if something breaks after launch?",
        "answer": "You're covered. Every project includes 6 months of free bug fixes and support. If something breaks, we fix it—no questions asked, no extra charges. After the support period, we offer affordable maintenance plans to keep things running smoothly."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I know you'll actually deliver?",
        "answer": "Track record speaks for itself: 98% on-time delivery rate, 50+ successful projects, and clients who come back for more. We also provide weekly progress demos—you'll see your project evolving in real-time, so there are no surprises at the end."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes you different from cheaper freelancers?",
        "answer": "Cheaper often costs more in the long run. We've rescued many projects from freelancers who disappeared or delivered buggy code. With us, you get: fixed pricing (no hourly billing games), professional project management, quality assurance testing, proper documentation, and ongoing support. We're a long-term partner, not a one-off transaction."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long will my project take?",
        "answer": "Typical timelines: Simple websites (2-4 weeks), web applications (6-12 weeks), mobile apps (8-16 weeks). We'll give you an accurate timeline during our discovery call, and we're transparent about what affects delivery—we won't promise something we can't deliver."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you work with startups or just established businesses?",
        "answer": "Both! We've helped startups launch their first MVP and scaled enterprise solutions for established companies. What matters is whether we can genuinely help you succeed. If we don't think we're the right fit, we'll tell you honestly."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I need changes during development?",
        "answer": "Changes are normal and expected. Minor adjustments within scope are included. For larger changes, we'll discuss the impact on timeline and budget before proceeding—you're always in control. Our weekly demos help catch any misalignments early, before they become expensive."
